After the Philadelphia Plea Deals won the Savage Scrimmage Series, they threw a massive party to celebrate. As Hellgorger's Howlers had just recently disbanded, I was free to market my services to them, and they agreed to be the first customers for the newly branded Suneater's Entertainment and Rentals.

Despite being rats their headquarters was quite clean, and I earned a lot of good tips. This is also when I approached Nheazzedja and Crimson Beauty about joining the company.
