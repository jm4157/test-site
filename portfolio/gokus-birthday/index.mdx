My largest party to date is Goku Hikari Joestar's birthday party. M.O.M. went all out on ordering services.

Nheazzedja Gloomfall burst out of a cake, Crimson Beauty tackled guests that tried to leave early, Daisy stood around eating fistfuls of cake, and I stood around and flexed for a while while Goku clapped for me.

It was a great first event to really put us on the map and fund our offices for the next month.
