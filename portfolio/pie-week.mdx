Pie Week is one of the few halfling holidays to have spread past the Mootland borders, which is why I was delighted when Abby Applebottom invited me and my troupe to perform at the traditional Sauerapfel Pie Week celebration.

It was a grand event, focusing largely on apple pastries made from the vast groves of apple trees the village is named for, and everyone was so friendly it hardly felt like work at all. It was an honor to be a part of the reenactment of Ferdy Piefellow's discovery of pies.
